Goal: compare and make sure that the simplified calculations give the same results as the ones in Veres.

How to:
- Establish the same hydrodynamics and air cushion properties as with the Veres model.
- Use Veres results without air cushion, and add these terms in Python.
- Make sure these match the results from Veres with the air cushion.

Where?
- In the file hydrodynamics conceptual SES.py the Veres hydrodynamic properties are imported from input.re7 files.
  In the same script the same hydrodynamic properties are derived from the simplified SES geometry.
