Goal: compare and make sure that the simplified calculations give the same results as the ones in Veres.

How to:
- Establish the same hydrodynamics and air cushion properties as with the Veres model.
- Use Veres results without air cushion, and add these terms in Python.
- Make sure these match the results from Veres with the air cushion.

Where?
- In the file hydrodynamics conceptual SES.py the Veres hydrodynamic properties are imported from input.re7 files.
  In the same script the same hydrodynamic properties are derived from the simplified SES geometry.

Thoughts:
- It seems like the restoring terms due to the side hulls are correct. There are some small round-off(?) error. This got
  confirmed by checking Veres results without any air cushion.
- The terms coupled with the uniform pressure DOF appears to be correct. It is also her some round-off(?) error here as
  it is used different number of sample points in the fan characteristic curves.
  The terms that agree well are: C_37_c, C_57_c, C_77_c, B_77_c, B_75_c and B_73_c
- The terms that are not correct yet is the restoring in heave and pitch. It is believed this is because the python-code
  does not take into account any terms due to the seal at the aft and front. The seals should contribute with restoring
  both in heave and pitch. The VERES documentation should be studied and the calculation of these terms shall be
  implemented to confirm if the difference is in fact due to this.
- After implementing the restoring from the bow and stern seals it appears that the restoring in heave and pitch also
  matches the one that comes from Veres. Further investigation is needed.
- The relative error between the stiffness terms when using the air cushion used in Veres and use the hydrodynamic
  restoring and adding the sir cushion terms in the Python programs gives a negligible error. This is true with the
  exception of the C_57 term. This should be zero. In Veres the motion coordinate system located at 0.00002m in front
  of the Lpp/2 instead of exactly 0.0. Thus the term is calculated as C_57 = -7.9. Simple hand calculations show that it
  comes from the numerical uncertainty. Therefore this error is disregarded as it is due to round-off error.
- For the damping terms the relative error for B_73 and B_77 is small, but for B_75 it is 1. This is for the same reason
  as for the C_57 term. It should be zero, but as the coordinate system is not located at exactly Lpp/2 we get a nonzero
  value.

Checking how excitation from the seals are implemented, and how wave pumping is introduced.
- When comparing the complex amplitude of the excitation load in heave and pitch it seems like absolute value of the
  complex number is correct, but the phase is wrong. To a good accuracy I get -a+b*i, but should get -b+a*i. Thus need
  to look into the definitions of the coordinate systems etc.
- It now appears that the definition of the position of the skirts is not the coordinate in the motion coordinate system
  , but rather the absolute distance. When now multiplying the excitation in heave and pitch with the complex value 1j
  the correct phase of the excitation is retrieved. This is a bit sketchy, but since the excitation from the skirts will
  not play a crucial role in the hydrodynamic analysis of the SES-X vessel this will be good enough for now.
- Noticed that the pitching moment due to the air skirts was not correct, but had the wrong sign. Therefore it was just
  multiplied with -1 to get the correct value. Again a bit sketchy, but it is not a vital part of the program.

Computing RAOs after checking that hydrodynamic coefficients and loads are correct
- Did not get the correct values. The values are not exactly equal to the ones from the Excel sheet post-processor
- Tried to compute the natural frequencies for an arbitrary wave frequency with its corresponding added mass matrix.
