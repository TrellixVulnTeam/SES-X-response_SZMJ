How to build the program to include spatially varying pressure:

Define input parameters.
    - What are the input parameters?
        - Loading condition
            o Mass matrix
            o Velocity
            o Trim and draft
                - Submergence at AP and FP
            o Incident wave frequencies
            o Wave spectrum(For linearizing leakage)
        - Fan characteristics
            o Mean air cushion pressure
            o Slope at equilibrium
        - Geometries
            o Air cushion area
                - Beam, width and height
            o
        - Hydrodynamic coefficients (From VERES)
            o Added mass
            o Wave radiation damping
            o Hydrostatic restoring
        - Physical constants
            o Density of water
            o Density of air
            o Speed of sound
            o Atmospheric pressure
