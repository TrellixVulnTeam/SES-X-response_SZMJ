Goal: compare and make sure that the simplified calculations give the same results as the ones in Veres.

How to:
- Establish the same hydrodynamics and air cushion properties as with the Veres model.
- Use Veres results without air cushion, and add these terms in Python.
- Make sure these match the results from Veres with the air cushion.

Where?
- In the file hydrodynamics conceptual SES.py the Veres hydrodynamic properties are imported from input.re7 files.
  In the same script the same hydrodynamic properties are derived from the simplified SES geometry.

Thoughts:
- It seems like the restoring terms due to the side hulls are correct. There are some small round-off(?) error. This got
  confirmed by checking Veres results without any air cushion.
- The terms coupled with the uniform pressure DOF appears to be correct. It is also her some round-off(?) error here as
  it is used different number of sample points in the fan characteristic curves.
  The terms that agree well are: C_37_c, C_57_c, C_77_c, B_77_c, B_75_c and B_73_c
- The terms that are not correct yet is the restoring in heave and pitch. It is believed this is because the python-code
  does not take into account any terms due to the seal at the aft and front. The seals should contribute with restoring
  both in heave and pitch. The VERES documentation should be studied and the calculation of these terms shall be
  implemented to confirm if the difference is in fact due to this.
- After implementing the restoring from the bow and stern seals it appears that the restoring in heave and pitch also
  matches the one that comes from Veres. Further investigation is needed.
- The relative error between the stiffness terms when using the air cushion used in Veres and use the hydrodynamic
  restoring and adding the sir cushion terms in the Python programs gives a negligible error. This is true with the
  exception of the C_57 term. This should be zero. In Veres the motion coordinate system located at 0.00002m in front
  of the Lpp/2 instead of exactly 0.0. Thus the term is calculated as C_57 = -7.9. Simple hand calculations show that it
  comes from the numerical uncertainty. Therefore this error is disregarded as it is due to round-off error.
